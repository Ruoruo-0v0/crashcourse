#   This should be a one (maybe two) paragraph description of the talk. In my

#   how it got to be that way, and what you can do to give fancy talks as well.

  subtitle: learn the foundations of web development
  description: >
    Every page you see on the web is composed of HTML & CSS. HTML determines
    how a document is structured, while CSS controls how it's displayed. Using
    just a little bit of knowledge, it's easy to make quite impressive-looking
    sites.

  subtitle: make your pages interactive with JavaScript
  description: >
    JavaScript is everywhere on the Web. With only a few lines of code, we can
    make immersive web applications, entertaining games, and interactive sites.
    Learning JavaScript is somewhat treacherous if you’re just starting out, so
    we’ll make sure to introduce you to JavaScript in a way that will enable
    you to continue learning more.

    Participants in this workshop will complete exercises related to common
    JavaScript tasks.
