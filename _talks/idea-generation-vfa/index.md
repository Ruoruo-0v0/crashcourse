subtitle: help make a difference through startups
description: >
  Join us for dinner as we hear from Venture for America, a fellowship program
  for recent grads who want to learn how to build a business while making an
  impact. VFA Fellows get training and join a startup in an emerging US city,
  where they learn hands-on what it takes to build a company and become a
  successful entrepreneur.
