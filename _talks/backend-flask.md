title: Backend Development in Flask
subtitle: learn to make powerful, dynamic websites
description: >
  The backend is all about storing and persisting information. If you want to
  save a user’s preferences, do complicated calculations, or store a lot of
  information, you’re going to need a backend.<br><br>

  Flask is a popular micro web application framework written in Python.
  Participants in this workshop will first get a brief overview of what backend
  engineering is before we will learn how to make a simple blog using Flask. The
  workshop will go over templating with Jinja, setting up forms, as well as user
  registration and login with a database.
