description: >
  Computer Vision can be used to create truly impressive applications in a short amount of time during a Hackathon. OpenCV is a popular Open Source library that contains pre-implemented computer vision algorithms. In this Crash Course, we will briefly go through some applications using OpenCV with concrete examples.


  We will cover 3D Stereo Reconstruction, Optical Character Recognition and Face Detection.

## How to Attend

[Install OpenCV 2.4.9][opencv]


[Install Python >= 2.7][python]


Code will be uploaded on Github and office hours will be held for further clarification after.


This will be a fairly advanced course so familiarity with python would be useful. Feel free to attend regardless since the code will be up on github.
