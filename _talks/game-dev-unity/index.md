This talk is designed for people who have never opened Unity before. No prior
programming experience is necessary (the tutorial was written and is taught by a
non-programmer!)

Attendees should download Unity before attending. It takes a good long while to
download, so give it some time. Unity is free and joining the community is a
great force in keeping it free, so don't be afraid to make a Unity account too.
Before the tutorial, attendees should also download [this little package of
assets][1] and remember where they put them! Be sure to have a laptop!
