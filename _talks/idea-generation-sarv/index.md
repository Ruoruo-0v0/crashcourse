  Violence (SARV) committee. You'll learn about the issues at stake when dealing

The first weekend's talk will feature Jess Klein, Coordinator of Gender Programs
and Sexual Assault Violence Prevention at the Office of Community Standards and
Integrity, and Janel Sutkus, the Director of Institutional Research and
Analysis. Jess will talk about the issues at large, speaking from her experience
as faculty advisor to the Survivor Support Network. Janel will then continue,
focusing on the issues as they pertain specifically to the CMU campus, pulling
from the Sexual Assault and Relationship Violence Study.

The second weekend's talk will feature Jamie Edwards and Holly Hippensteel from
the Office of Title IX Initiatives and a representative from Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape (PAAR). The Title IX Office will delve deeper into the issue of
sexual assault and relationship violence on CMUâ€™s campus. Specifically, they
will cover the reporting mechanisms that are in place for students, faculty and
staff. PAAR is one of the oldest rape crisis centers in the United States and
the only center in Allegheny County solely devoted to sexual violence. Their
representative will discuss how the issue of sexual violence affects many
communities within Pittsburgh and the work that they do to combat this injustice
and provide support for all affected by this issue.

All of the speakers will be giving guidance on how TartanHacks participants can
make a social impact through TartanHacks by giving their input into what kinds
of applications and programs would be useful to them with their work on gender
based violence on campus.
