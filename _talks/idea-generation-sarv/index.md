description: >
  Join us for dinner with Student Government's Sexual Assault & Relationship
  Violence (SARV) committee. You'll learn about the issues at stake when dealing
  with these sensitive issues, and some areas that could be greatly aided
  by useful new apps. If you're looking for ideas for TartanHacks, perhaps
  something here will pique your interest!
speaker: Satvika Neti
