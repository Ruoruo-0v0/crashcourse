title: HTML & CSS Primer
subtitle: learn the foundations of web development
description: >
  HTML and CSS form the foundation for building websites on the Internet. If you want to learn web development, HTML and CSS should be your first stepping stone. This talk will be interactive: attendees can follow along with the concepts introduced in the slides with the companion tutorial. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have a custom resume website.


  The HTML and CSS talk will do two things. The first is to show your how to write HTML and CSS code that will render a webpage just the way you want. The second is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of webpages, known as the DOM. Both are important if you would like to learn to make more interactive websites using JavaScript.

## How to Attend

  Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend [Chrome][1] and [Sublime Text][2] or even Vim if youâ€™re comfortable with it. Brackets is also a great editor for web development, but might be a bit overwhelming if this is your first experience writing a lot of code.

No prior web development experience is required. Familiarity with programming in general is certainly useful but by no means required.
