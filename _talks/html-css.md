title: HTML & CSS
subtitle: learn the foundations of web development
description: >
  Every page you see on the web is composed of HTML & CSS. HTML is a markup
  language that structures the content of a web page, while CSS controls how
  it’s displayed. During this talk, we will be learning how to use these
  languages together to create semantic, beautiful static websites.

  Please bring a computer with a text editor (such as GitHub’s Atom) and Google
  Chrome installed.

No prior web development experience is required. Familiarity with programming in
general is certainly useful but by no means required.
