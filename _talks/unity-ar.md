subtitle: integrate the real and virtual world
description: >
  Augmented reality applications have the power to transform a user's environment into a game or interactive experience.  They blend the digital and physical worlds, enabling new, more immersive modes of interaction.  But while AR apps may look and feel sophisticated, they don't have to be hard to make.  In this talk, we'll walk you through using Unity and the Vuforia API to make your own augmented reality apps come to life.


  We’ll cover the different types of tracking methods and build a quick demo application without any code.  After that, we’ll touch on Unity scripting as well as a few other skills you’ll need to make a full application.
