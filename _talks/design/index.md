title: Web & Mobile App Design
subtitle: good design entails more than just looks
description: >
  When it comes to building products that users interact with, having good
  design is pivotal. Most people think they can accomplish this with just a few
  flashes of color and some fancy logo design. However, good design is more
  nuanced. It's all about how natural it is for people to use the app you've
  created. We'll walk you through the process of designing a user experience,
  from start to finish. When you're done with this workshop, you'll be able to
  think through a product and design it so that it not only looks beautiful, but
  also it's intuitive and pleasant to use.

a thing or two about thoughtful design should come by.
