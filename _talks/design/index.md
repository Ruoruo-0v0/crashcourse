subtitle: good design entails more than just looks
description: >
  When it comes to building products that users interact with, having good
  design is pivotal. Most people think they can accomplish this with just a few
  flashes of color and some fancy logo design. However, good design is more
  nuanced. It's all about how natural it is for people to use the app you've
  created. We'll discuss some common techniques for how to think about design
  from the standpoint of both web and native apps.
